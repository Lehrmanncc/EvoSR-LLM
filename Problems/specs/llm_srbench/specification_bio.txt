### Problem Task
Discover a mathematical function skeleton for population dynamics. The goal is to model the population growth rate as a function of time and the current population.

### Equation Input Specification
`t` (Time), `P` (Population at time t).

### Equation Output Specification
The output is (`dP_dt`: Population growth rate).

### Equation Code Example
```python
import numpy as np

def equation(t, P, params):
    dP_dt = params[0] * t + params[1] * P
    return dP_dt
```
