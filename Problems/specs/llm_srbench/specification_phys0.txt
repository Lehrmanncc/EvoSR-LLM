### Problem Task
Discover a mathematical function skeleton for a physics nonl-linear harmonic oscillator system. The goal is to model acceleration from state variables such as position, velocity and time, consistent with dynamical systems.

### Equation Input Specification
`x`: Position at time t
`t`: Time
`v`: Velocity at time t


### Equation Output Specification
`dv_dt`: Acceleration in Nonl-linear Harmonic Oscillator

### Equation Code Example
```python
import numpy as np

def equation(x, t, v, params):
    dv_dt = params[0] * x + params[1] * t + params[2] * v
    return dv_dt
```
