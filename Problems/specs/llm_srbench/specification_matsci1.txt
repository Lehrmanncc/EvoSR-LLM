### Problem Task
Discover a mathematical function skeleton for a materials stress system. The goal is to model a stress (e.g., sigma) as a function of strain and temperature.

### Equation Input Specification
`epsilon`: Strain (observations of engineering strain)
`T`: Temperature (observations of temperature)

### Equation Output Specification
sigma`: Stress (resulting stress computed from the function)


### Equation Code Example
```python
import numpy as np

def equation(epsilon, T, params):
    sigma = params[0] * epsilon + params[1] * T
    return sigma
```
