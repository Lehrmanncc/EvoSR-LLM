### Problem Task
Find the mathematical function skeleton that represents stress, given data on strain and temperature in an Aluminium rod for both elastic and plastic regions.

### Equation Input Specification
'a' is representing observations of strain, 'temp' is representing observations of temperature.

### Equation Output Specification
's' is representing stress as the result of applying the mathematical function to the inputs.

### Equation Code Example
```python
import numpy as np

def equation(a, temp, params):
    s = params[0] * a  +  params[1] * temp
    return s
```
