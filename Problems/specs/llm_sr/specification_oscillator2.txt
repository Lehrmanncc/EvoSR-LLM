### Problem Task
Find the mathematical function skeleton that represents acceleration in a damped nonlinear oscillator system with driving force, given data on time, position, and velocity.

### Equation Input Specification
't' is representing time, 'x' is representing observations of current position, 'v' is representing observations of velocity.

### Equation Output Specification
'a' is representing acceleration as the result of applying the mathematical function to the inputs.

### Equation Code Example
```python
import numpy as np

def equation(t, x, v, params):
    a = params[0] * t + params[1] * x  +  params[2] * v + params[3]
    return a
```
