### Problem Task
Find the mathematical function skeleton that represents Escherichia coli bacterial growth rate, given data on population density, substrate concentration, temperature, and pH level.

### Equation Input Specification
'b' is representing observations of population density of the bacterial species, 's' is representing observations of substrate concentration, 'temp' is representing observations of temperature, 'pH' is representing observations of pH level.

### Equation Output Specification
'r' is representing bacterial growth rate as the result of applying the mathematical function to the inputs.

### Equation Code Example
```python
import numpy as np

def equation(b, s, temp, pH, params):
    r = params[0] * b + params[1] * s + params[2] * temp + params[3] * pH + params[4]
    return r
```
