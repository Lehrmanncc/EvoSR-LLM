### Problem Task
Discover a mathematical function skeleton for a chemistry reaction kinetics system. The goal is to model a reaction rate (e.g., dA/dt) as a function of time and species concentrations.

### Equation Input Specification
`t` (Time), `A` (Concentration of species A).


### Equation Output Specification
The output is (`dA_dt`: Rate of change of concentration). .

### Equation Code Example
```python
import numpy as np

def equation(t, A, params):
    dA_dt = params[0] * t + params[1] * A
    return dA_dt
```
